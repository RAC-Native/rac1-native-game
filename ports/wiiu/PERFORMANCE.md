# Performance on the Wii U: the machine and the plan

After the port is complete (PLAN.md; MRP_LITE.md: Veldin rendered and playable first).
The direction (Daino, 2026-10-27): port everything, then optimise for the console in detail - the rendering pipeline may be
changed for the Wii U where it does not fit (the MRP was made to be malleable; a GS replica is not the way).

## The machine

- **CPU, Espresso**: three PowerPC 750-family cores (the Gekko / Broadway line) at 1.24 GHz, big-endian. Per core 32 KB of
  instruction and 32 KB of data cache; the L2 differs: 2 MB on core 1, 512 KB on cores 0 and 2 (the game runs on core 1). No
  AltiVec: the SIMD is the paired singles (two 32-bit floats per instruction, from the GameCube). Also from the GameCube: the
  locked cache (half the data cache as a scratchpad, filled by its own small DMA) and the write-gather pipe (data streamed to
  the GPU).
- **GPU, Latte**: AMD R700-derived (the Radeon HD 4000 family), ~160 shader units at 550 MHz (~176 GFLOPS), unified shaders,
  a tessellator. GX2 has no storage buffers, no multi-draw-indirect; GX2_SHADER_MODE_COMPUTE_SHADER exists in the API, its use
  from homebrew to verify. 32 MB of eDRAM on the GPU's die (MEM1): fast, for colour / depth buffers and render targets.
- **Memory**: 2 GB of DDR3, 1 GB for a game (MEM2), ~12.8 GB/s.
- **Coprocessors**: none like the PS2's VUs or the Cell's SPUs. A DSP for the audio (AX's mixing runs there: the port's two AX
  voices already use it), an ARM (Starbuck) for security and I/O that runs the system (not open to a game), the hardware video
  encoder / decoder (the GamePad's stream).

What the PS2 did on its VUs moves: VU1's work to the GPU's shaders (the MRP's), VU0's to the CPU's paired singles or the GPU.

## The plan, in order

1. **Measure first.** The CPU with the sampling profiler (RAC1_WIIU_SAMPLE, tools/samples.py); the GPU with GX2 timestamps
   around each pass (the world, the mobys, the 2D) - to know whether a frame is bound by the CPU or the GPU. Not known yet: a
   230-frame run took 19 s with one moby draw per frame, 22-35 s with all of them (2026-10-27).
2. **All three cores.** Core 1: the game's logic alone. Cores 0 and 2: the MRP's preparation (the mobys' frame, the world's
   instances, the colours), the chain reader, the audio. Then pipelined: while the game updates frame N + 1, the other cores
   prepare and the GPU draws frame N (the MRP's preparation already runs on workers on the PC).
3. **No emulation left on the hot path.** The GS replica's walk for the 2D replaced by main's mrp_2d with a GX2 backend (and
   main's chain reader, mrp_chain); the mobys' VU0 skinning (moby_joints, fin_lanes, maddbc, mulbc: at the top of the
   profile) written natively with the paired singles, or moved to the GPU.
4. **The GPU: less work per draw.** GX2 display lists (GX2BeginDisplayList / GX2CallDisplayList) for the static world,
   recorded once per level and replayed each frame; the level's data resident on the GPU (templates, colours), only the
   instances per frame - today blocks are written per draw; instancing (GX2DrawIndexedEx with several instances) where a mesh
   repeats; colour and depth buffers in MEM1.
5. **The resolution, an option** (to try in real time): the TV's picture rendered at 1080p or 720p (then scaled), chosen in
   the options or run.cfg; 1080p kept if it holds, 720p otherwise, as many Wii U games did. The GamePad is 854 x 480.
6. **CPU micro-optimisation, last, measured on the console each time**: with 32 KB of instruction cache bigger code is often
   slower (forced inlining made it 5-10% slower); compact data for the data cache; the locked cache for the hottest streams.

## Later

- The relighting of ties and shrubs (off on the Wii U with RAC1_WORLD_PASS_SKIP=6: their colours stay the level's load ones):
  the game's on a worker core, or a relighting of our own.
- The GamePad as a second screen: a real-time map, the weapons' quick select.

## Progress

- Measured on the console (2026-10-28; Veldin, explore, everything on): 3.45 host frames/s, 17.1 game steps/s; with the world off
  (RAC1_WIIU_WORLD=0) 6.74 frames/s, 28.8 steps/s; with the GamePad not drawn (RAC1_WIIU_DRC=0) only 3.75. The world backend's
  log: ~4,000 GX2 draws a call (the TV's and the GamePad's: two calls a frame), 72,800 triangles, 1 batch, 4.49 ms CPU a call, 155
  instances; the tfrags 161 draws a call (their CPU route 4.3 ms a frame); the mobys 424 draws, 2.17 ms a call. The game thread's
  samples ~47% in Cafe OS (waiting, most likely on the GPU). So the world's ties / shrubs - one GX2DrawIndexedEx per (instance,
  template run) with a uniform block per draw, Veldin's one batch drawn twice (its AFAIL pass) - are the main cost.
- The ties' / shrubs' draws merged (mrp_world_merge.inc, mrp_world_gx2.cpp; RAC1_WIIU_WORLD_MERGE, default 3). A draw command's
  record (texture word, layer, draw_flags, FOGCOL) belongs to its template run, not to its instance: the level's vertices carry their
  run (an attribute; a vertex two runs share copied - none on Veldin), the indices are made absolute, and per frame the runs' records
  go into a table (R32UI, 4 texels a run) the vertex shader reads by the vertex's run - a command whose record differs from its run's
  in that frame is drawn alone, as before. Then, in the commands' own order: an instance's consecutive commands are one draw (their
  indices follow each other in the level's: no copying on Veldin), the batch's texture units all bound (uT1..uT15: the pixel shader
  samples the triangle's unit, as the PC's units), and consecutive instances drawing the same commands - the tie / shrub passes draw a
  packet for each instance of a group in turn - one instanced draw (gl_InstanceID, read from R0.w in CafeGLSL's disassembly; the
  instances' 256-byte slots in a row). Nothing is reordered (an instanced draw is its instances' draws in turn), so the picture is the
  same whatever the blending (Veldin's batch blends). One block slot per instance per frame (the instanced rows besides), the frame's
  data written once by the TV's call into a ring of their own and reused by the GamePad's.
  On the PC (a harness over the same CPU code: the PC's static path at RAC1_MRP_LOD=1, Veldin explore 600 frames - ~2,000 commands,
  ~240 instances a frame, the Wii U's single batch): commands per frame 690-2,320; merged by instance and unit (mode 1) -27%; by
  instance (mode 2) about -50%; with the instancing (mode 3) 78-310 draws, ~8x fewer (~225 instanced draws of ~880 instances a
  frame); every frame's merged draws expanded back into (instance, vertices, record, unit) in order equal to the commands' (explore 600
  frames, GOTO=0@60 forward 600: 0 differences); the plan's CPU time 0.01-0.04 ms a frame on the PC. Expected on the console: ~4,000
  GX2 draws a call down to ~500, the per-draw blocks (~2,000 a frame) down to ~1,000 slots written once a frame.
  Not verified on the console yet: the R32UI run table's byte order (taken as the colours': swapped), gl_InstanceID on GX2's
  instanced draws, the 16 pixel samplers. RAC1_WIIU_WORLD_MERGE=0 / 1 / 2 / 3 isolate each step; the log line every 120 calls gives
  the draw commands, GX2 draws, triangles, uniform blocks written, CPU ms a call and the plan's share.
  Next: the tfrags' ranges by unit could be one draw per batch the same way (their vertices hold their unit; the pixel shader's units);
  the frame's preparation on another core.

### The host frame by stage (2026-10-28, RAC1_WIIU_TIMING=1)

Veldin explore, everything on, the world's draws merged (one log line every 60 host frames; ms per host frame):

| configuration | host frame | game steps | world prepare | finish (the GPU's frame) | frames/s |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| everything on | 231 | 119 | 22 | 81 | 3.48 |
| mobys not drawn (RAC1_WIIU_MRP_STAGE=3) | 226 | 119 | 22 | 76 | 3.55 |
| world not drawn (RAC1_WIIU_WORLD_STAGE=3, RAC1_WIIU_TFRAG_STAGE=3) | 172 | 117 | 22 | 25 | 4.50 |
| world grey (no texture, blending, alpha test: debug 2) | 216 | 122 | 22 | 63 | 3.75 |
| world one draw a call (debug 2048) | 176 | 119 | 22 | 26 | 4.51 |
| the frame at half size (RAC1_WIIU_VPSCALE=0.5) | 183 | 120 | 22 | 33 | 4.27 |

- The draw count was not the bottleneck: 8x fewer world draws (4,000 -> ~220 a call) changed nothing on screen (CPU 4.5 -> 0.8 ms
  a call). The commands' building is ~11 ms a frame in all.
- The GPU's frame (WHBGfxFinishRender waits for it) is ~80 ms, ~55 of them the world's, and mostly pixels: a quarter of the
  pixels takes it to 33. The PS2 drew 512 x 416; 1080p is 8.75 times the pixels, with the plants' and rocks' overdraw. The
  texturing is a part (~13 ms), not the most. -> the 720p option, then the overdraw (early Z with the alpha test's discard, the
  passes' order), then the pixel shader.
- The game's own steps are ~24 ms each (~5 per host frame with RAC1_REALTIME): for 60 steps a second they must come under
  16 ms - the CPU work (VU0 emulation, moby joints, the passes) is the second front.
- The world's CPU prepare, 22 ms a frame on the game's thread (static frame, scene, triangles, tfrag's CPU route): to a worker core.
- The GamePad's picture is cheap (~10%).

### CPU and GPU overlapped, the world's preparation on a worker (2026-10-28)

- wiiu_gfx.cpp no longer waits for the GPU at a frame's end (WHBGfxFinishRender's GX2DrawDone): the frame's commands' timestamp is
  waited for at the next frame's start, before it writes the memory the GPU reads (RAC1_WIIU_OVERLAP=0 as before).
- The world's preparation in two halves: what reads EE memory on the game's thread, build_triangles and tfrag's CPU route on a
  worker on core 0 (RAC1_WIIU_WORLD_ASYNC=0 all on the game's thread), joined before the world's draw.
- Veldin explore, everything on: host frame 231 -> 155 ms, 3.48 -> 4.96 frames a second, 17.1 -> 23.4 game steps a second; the
  GPU's wait 81 -> 6 ms. Left on the game's thread: the game's steps (~117 ms: ~5 x 23 ms) and the world's first half (~19 ms:
  the colours' compare, static_frame_build, scene_from_static). The picture as before (shots at game frames 150 / 200).
